Caleb is the **Chief Editor & Owner** of Glass Kraken. I'm here to help you get as excited as I am about NHL Seattle coming to town (err, the Krakens...). My proudest accomplishment is coming up with the name for this site, perhaps the most aptly named sports blog ever.

<br>

By day I work for an insurance company, but by night I am working to make this a place where you can come to get information on NHL Seattle - from a fan's perspective.

<br>

I should be clear - I'm a fairly new hockey fan looking to develop a passion for the sport.
