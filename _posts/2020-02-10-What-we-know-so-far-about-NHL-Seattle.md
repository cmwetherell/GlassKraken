# What is the team name for NHL Seattle?

According to the rumor mill, the most likely mascot will be a 'Kraken', which is a sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. Seattle Times [ran a competition](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/sports/name-the-seattle-nhl-team/) to determine what the locals would like to see, and Kraken lost in the first round to Steelheads in the ***first round!***

<br>

So, why do we think the mascot will be Kraken? In an interview on Sirius XM's NHL Network Radio, John Hoven reported that he heard the name would be 'Kraken' and that he was 'surprised' at the choice. Hoven is the editor of [Mayors Manor](http://mayorsmanor.com/), a blog dedicated to the Los Angeles Kings. Following the rumor, [SBNation](https://www.sbnation.com/2020/2/8/21128447/seattle-kraken-logo-uniform-jersey) graced us with some logos and uniform concepts. My personal favorite is the tentacle shaped 'S':

Following the viral explosion of 'Kraken' being selected, NHL Seattle sent a tweet seemingly narrowing down the options, but confirming none of them:

<br>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While we’re aware of some fishy rumors surrounding our team name, please rest assured we’re doing our due diligence by scouring the depths of the ocean, the tallest mountains, and the densest parts of the forest to find the right name for our great, green city.</p>&mdash; NHL Seattle (@NHLSeattle_) <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLSeattle_/status/1222658065024995328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br>
It's still unclear what the mascot will be for NHL Seattle, but Kraken is certainly a front runner.
