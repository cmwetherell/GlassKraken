<p>In 2019, I went to a Vegas Golden Knights vs San Jose Sharks at the SAP Center in San Jose, CA. It was the first time I had ever sat in glass seats at an NHL game - and it was incredible. The soundscape of the game was totally different so close to the action. Several times players were checked into the boards, the puck hit the glass in front of me, and a few goals were scored.
<br /><br />
I had so much fun I decided I would try and turn my season ticket deposit for NHL Seattle ‚ÄúClub‚Äù seats into seats in the first row, on the glass! When I met with the team to do go through the seat selection process, they had been selling through club seats at a rapid pace - and there were no ice (glass) seats left. I told him I was a bit disappointed and was hoping to get as close to the action as possible. I decided to wait for the general seat selection process - but I did tell him, ‚ÄúPLEASE - If more glass seats become available, let me know. I will buy them.‚Äù
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Fortunately for me, a few weeks later I got a call and the representative from the team told me that two glass seats had become available and asked if I wanted them. YES. Now I am the proud owner of NWICE Row AA Seats 19 and 20. These seats are a huge part of what is making me so excited for the Kraken to start pounding people into the boards, and a big part of why I created this site - a journey for me to become more connected with the team and share my experiences with other fans.</p>
