<p>Caleb is the <strong>Chief Editor &amp; Owner</strong> of Glass Kraken. I’m here to help you get as excited as I am about NHL Seattle coming to town (err, the Krakens…). My proudest accomplishment is coming up with the name for this site, perhaps the most aptly named sports blog ever.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By day I work for an insurance company, but by night I am working to make this a place where you can come to get information on NHL Seattle - from a fan’s perspective.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I should be clear - I’m a fairly new hockey fan looking to develop a passion for the sport.</p>
