<h1 id="what-is-the-team-name-for-nhl-seattle">What is the team name for NHL Seattle?</h1>

<p>According to the rumor mill, the most likely mascot will be a ‚ÄòKraken‚Äô, which is a sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. Seattle Times <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/sports/name-the-seattle-nhl-team/">ran a competition</a> to determine what the locals would like to see, and Kraken lost in the first round to Steelheads in the <strong><em>first round!</em></strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So, why do we think the mascot will be Kraken? In an interview on Sirius XM‚Äôs NHL Network Radio, John Hoven reported that he heard the name would be ‚ÄòKraken‚Äô and that he was ‚Äòsurprised‚Äô at the choice. Hoven is the editor of <a href="http://mayorsmanor.com/">Mayors Manor</a>, a blog dedicated to the Los Angeles Kings. Following the rumor, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2020/2/8/21128447/seattle-kraken-logo-uniform-jersey">SBNation</a> graced us with some logos and uniform concepts. My personal favorite is the tentacle shaped S:</p>
